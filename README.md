# Alfred Workflow - Wifi Speedtest
Test the Upload/Download speed of the wifi you're currently on.

## Installation

1. Install `speedtest-cli` on your system using homebrew: `brew install speedtest-cli`.
2. Download the [workflow](https://github.com/mmroczka/alfred-speedtest/blob/master/Speedtest.alfredworkflow).
3. Double click the downloaded workflow to install it in Alfred.

## Usage

Using the keyword `speedtest` in alfred, select the workflow then wait 30 seconds while the speedtest is running (a notification will appear letting you know it's started the test). After 30 seconds, view the notification that pops up with the results of the speedtest.

## Known issues

Installing without homebrew will result in you needing to change the path name. Please change the path name in the bash script to wherever the `speedtest-cli` is installed on your system if you don't want to use Homebrew to install it.
